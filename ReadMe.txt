This is my very first server. It contains data on relevant food items. Based on the route it returns various food items in JSON. 

To use this, clone it to your local repository. Then run it using Node JS.

Note: This server uses Express and Node JS. 

The different routes return different relevant informations as: 

1. The '/health-api' route returns the health of the server.
2. The '/all' route returns list of all foods items
3. The '/vegetable' route returns list of all foods with category vegetable
4. The '/fruit' route returns list of all foods with category fruit
5. The '/protien' route returns list of all foods with category protien
6. The '/protien' route returns list of all foods with category protien
7. The '/calorie-above-100' route returns list of all foods with calories more than 100 calories
8. The '/calorie-below-100' route returns list of all foods with calories less than 100 calories
